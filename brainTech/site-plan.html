      <h4>What is AI?</h4>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
      </p>
      <h4>Why is artificial intelligence important?</h4>
      <p>AI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they may not have been aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors.

        This has helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has become one of the largest companies in the world by doing just that. It utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict when people are likely to need rides in certain areas, which helps proactively get drivers on the road before they're needed. As another example, Google has become one of the largest players for a range of online services by using machine learning to understand how people use their services and then improving them. In 2017, the company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, pronounced that Google would operate as an "AI first" company.
        
        Today's largest and most successful enterprises have used AI to improve their operations and gain advantage on their competitors.
        
        What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?
        Artificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly possible.
        
        While the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data that AI programming requires.</p>

      <h3>AI - Learning Path</h3>
      <h4>Reasons to Study Artificial Intelligence</h4>
      <p>
        Globally, the AI software market grew 54% in 2020 and is projected to continue growing almost 40% annually from now through 2023. While this means the future for AI is undeniably bright, there are also other reasons to consider studying it.

        Getting a great job might be easy with an AI degree, the major itself has a steep learning curve. Still, the value of the degree serves as motivation enough for many ambitious students who complete the major and reap a reward that far outweighs the invested time and effort.

        Let’s look at some reasons why an Artificial Intelligence degree is so valuable.
        Here’s an overview of the top 4 AI careers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning Engineers not only earn a higher pay than most, but they help design software capable of “learning” on its own to help automate unpredictable models. Working alongside data scientists, machine learning engineers build out theoretical models that help crunch enormous amounts of data in real-time. In other words, this job uses data modeling to help find patterns in high volumes of data or predict unseen circumstances. In some ways, machine learning engineers are helping predict the future!</li>
        <li>Robotics Engineers are also popular positions for their pay scale, a robotics engineer’s job is to develop machines that perform functions much like that of humans. This can apply to almost any industry and at any level of use, from common consumers to government intelligence. This job is perfect for the innovative computer scientist, allowing him or her to not only flex technical skillsets but also creativity.</li>
        <li>Computer Vision Engineers are in demand for doing work that as the name implies helps computers “see” images, process them, and learn. This data can include movement, distances, and movements. Much of the work done by computer vision engineers has a forward-facing impact on everyday life. For example, if your car has a rear-view camera that helps you park, this was developed by computer vision engineers.</li>
        <li>Data Scientists are also growing in high demand and outlook throughout every industry for doing a job heavily based on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting massive sets of data. They often work with machine learning engineers to help develop algorithms that clean the data for analysis. Once the analysis is complete, data scientists will then work to develop data-driven solutions to business problems from many fields. A specific skill set is required for this line of work, but it’s also a very versatile career and can lead to many industries of employment.</li>

      <h3>Books - Projects</h3>
      <h4>Books recomendations </h4>
      <p>
        “Reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary.” — Jim Rohn
      </p>
      <p>Reading books is one of the most important things which I should do this year to enhance my learning. I should say this, if you are a book lover then books are one of the best sources to enhance your learning. I can choose to read freely-available e-books or purchase the hardcopy, anything can work. There are a lot of books one can purchase and start reading but some good books which I would suggest reading are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python for Data Analysis - Wes McKinney</li>
        <li>An Introduction to Statistical Learning - Gareth James</li>
        <li>Superintelligence - Nick Bostrom</li>
        <li>Make your own Neuronal Network - Tariq Rashid</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence for dummies - Jhon Paul Mueller</li>
        <li>SuperIntelligence - Nick Bostrom</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Artificial Intelligence Projects Ideas for Beginners</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Resume Parser</li>
          <p>You can build a resume parser with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques that can skim through a candidate’s application and identify skilled candidates, filtering out people who fill their resume with unnecessary keywords.</p>
        <li>Fake News Detector </li>
          <p>You can use a pre-trained machine learning model called BERT to perform this classification. BERT is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that has been made open-source. You can load BERT into Python and just add one additional output layer for your text classification task.</p>
        <li>Translator App</li>
          <p>You can build your own AI translator app with a transformer. To do this, you can load a pre-trained transformer model into Python. Then, transform the text you want to translate into tokens and feed it into the pre-trained model.</p>
        <li>Instagram Spam Detection</li>
          <p>You can build a spam detection model using AI techniques to identify the difference between spam and legitimate comments.</p>
      </ul>
